Chunk 1: This section provides a comprehensive overview of the individual income tax formula and the fundamental principles governing tax deductions. It explains the distinction between above-the-line and below-the-line deductions, the statutory authority for deductions under Sections 162 and 212, and the requirements for expenses to qualify as legitimate deductions.

Additionally, it covers itemized deductions—particularly medical expenses, taxes, and qualified residence interest—highlighting the specific requirements, limitations, and tax treatment of each category.

Chunk 3: This section covered important tax deductions and credits, including investment interest limitations, charitable contribution rules and AGI limitations based on property type and organization type, casualty and theft loss requirements, and tax credits for energy efficiency and clean vehicles.
