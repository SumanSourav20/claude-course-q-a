C) BOI is currently on hold due to a Texas case and is considered a voluntary filing until around April
D) BOI reporting requirements have been permanently struck down by the Supreme Court

Explanation:

B: Incorrect. While 12/31/2024 was mentioned as the original deadline, BOI is currently on hold.
C: Correct. The Supreme Court ruled on one term of law, but a separate Texas case with a nationwide injunction is still ongoing. Currently, BOI is on hold and considered voluntary until approximately April when more clarity is expected.
D: Incorrect. The Supreme Court ruled on one legal aspect, but didn't permanently strike down BOI requirements.

## Question 2 (00:25:35 - 00:26:18)
Under what circumstances would a BOI filing need to be updated after the initial filing?

A) Every year as an annual filing requirement
B) Only if the business changes its tax structure
C) If the address changes or if the identification document number (like passport or driver's license) changes
D) Only if ownership percentages change among beneficial owners

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. BOI is not an annual filing requirement - it was described as "not a yearly filing" but a "onetime filing" unless certain changes occur.
B: Incorrect. Changes in tax structure weren't mentioned as requiring a BOI update.
C: Correct. The speaker specifically mentioned that updates are needed "if you switch your address" or if identification documents are renewed with different numbers (such as passport numbers changing upon renewal).
D: Incorrect. While ownership changes might logically require updates, this specific trigger wasn't mentioned in the content.

## Question 3 (00:26:46 - 00:28:10)
What approach did the speaker recommend for estimated tax calculations for clients in the upcoming year?

C) Waiting until tax law changes are finalized before providing estimates
D) Recommending clients pay the same amount as the previous year

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. The speaker specifically avoided recommending precise calculations due to potential tax law changes.
B: Correct. The speaker stated "I'm killing it on the safe harbors. Every client is gonna get a safe harbor estimate, and that way they know what it is to avoid any penalties." This approach protects clients from penalties regardless of tax law changes.
C: Incorrect. The speaker recommended providing safe harbor calculations now rather than waiting.

C) The expense must be medically necessary and federally legal
D) The expense must exceed 7.5% of AGI and be paid within the tax year

B: Incorrect. Pre-approval by the IRS isn't required for medical expense deductions.
C: Correct. The speaker specifically highlighted these two criteria: "Is the medical expense medically necessary and is it legal federally?" These are the fundamental tests for potential deductibility.
D: Incorrect. While medical expenses must exceed 7.5% of AGI to be deductible, this is a threshold requirement rather than a criterion for what qualifies as a medical expense.
