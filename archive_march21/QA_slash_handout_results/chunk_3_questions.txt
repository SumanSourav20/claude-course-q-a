## Question 1 (Pages 42-43)
What is required for substantiating a cash donation of $300 to a qualified charitable organization?

A. Only a bank record showing the contribution
B. Only a written record from the charity
C. Either a bank record or a written record from the charity
D. Both a bank record and a written record from the charity

explanation:
A: Incorrect: A bank record alone is sufficient for cash donations under $250, but for donations of $250 or more, a written receipt from the organization is also required.
B: Incorrect: While a written record from the charity is necessary for donations of $250 or more, for cash donations of any amount, taxpayers must maintain some form of record.
C: Correct: For cash donations under $250, the taxpayer must maintain as a record of the contribution either a bank record (such as a canceled check or credit card statement) or a written record from the charity. Either option fulfills the substantiation requirement for donations below $250.
D: Incorrect: Having both a bank record and a written record from the charity is not required for donations under $250. Either one of these records is sufficient for smaller donations, although for donations of $250 or more, a written receipt from the organization is specifically required.

## Question 2 (Pages 46-47)
When donating capital gain property to a 50% limit organization, what limitation applies if the donor elects not to reduce the fair market value by the amount of potential long-term capital gain?

A. 20% of AGI
B. 30% of AGI
C. 50% of AGI
D. 60% of AGI

explanation:
A: Incorrect: The 20% limitation applies to capital gain property donated to non-50% limit charities, not to 50% limit organizations when the donor makes no reduction election.
B: Correct: A special 30% limitation applies to gifts of capital gain property given to 50% limit organizations when the donor elects not to reduce the fair market value of the donated property by the amount that would have been long-term capital gain if sold.
C: Incorrect: The 50% limitation applies only if the donor elects to reduce the fair market value of the donated capital gain property by the amount that would have been long-term capital gain.
D: Incorrect: The 60% limitation applies specifically to cash contributions to 50% limit organizations, not to capital gain property donations.

## Question 3 (Pages 50-51)
When claiming a casualty loss deduction for a federally declared disaster area, what timing options does a taxpayer have?

A. Must claim in the year the loss occurred
B. May claim in either the year of loss or the preceding year
C. May claim in either the year of loss or the following year
D. May claim the loss over multiple years through amortization

explanation:
A: Incorrect: While claiming the loss in the year it occurred is one option, taxpayers with losses in federally declared disaster areas have additional timing flexibility.
B: Correct: The taxpayer has the option of deducting a disaster loss on either the return for the year in which the loss occurred or the preceding year's return (by filing an amended return). This flexibility allows taxpayers to receive tax benefits more quickly or to optimize the tax benefit based on income in different years.
C: Incorrect: While taxpayers can claim the loss in the year it occurred, the other option is to claim it on the preceding year's return, not the following year's return.
D: Incorrect: Casualty losses cannot be amortized over multiple years. They must be claimed either in the year of loss or on the preceding year's return for federally declared disaster areas.

C: Incorrect: $500 is the collective limit for all exterior doors combined, not the limit for a single door.
D: Incorrect: $600 is the maximum credit allowed for qualified energy property or for exterior windows and skylights, not for a single exterior door.

C. The Residential Clean Energy Credit expires in 2033, while the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit expires in 2032
D. The Residential Clean Energy Credit does not include labor costs

explanation:
