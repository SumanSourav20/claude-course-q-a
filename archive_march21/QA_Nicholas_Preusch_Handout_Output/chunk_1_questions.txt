Introduced in 2021, these forms provide standardized frameworks for reporting foreign income, deductions, credits, and other international tax elements at both the entity level (K-2) and partner/shareholder level (K-3). Compliance requires careful attention to filing requirements, timely distribution to all partners/shareholders, and comprehensive documentation to avoid substantial penalties that can reach up to $3,426,000 annually for missing K-3 distributions.
