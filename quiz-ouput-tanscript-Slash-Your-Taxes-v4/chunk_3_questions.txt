A) 20% of adjusted gross income
B) 30% of adjusted gross income
C) 50% of adjusted gross income
D) 60% of adjusted gross income

Explanation:

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. While profitability is considered, there's no specific amount that automatically qualifies an activity as a business.
B: Correct. The IRS defines a hobby as "an activity for which profit is not a primary motive." An activity must be engaged in with a profit motive to be considered a business.
C: Incorrect. While time and effort expended are factors considered, they alone don't determine whether an activity is a hobby or business.
