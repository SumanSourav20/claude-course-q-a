Chunk 1 (pages 4-22): **Explanation:**
A: This is incorrect. Justice Cardoza specifically rejected this interpretation, stating that the test was not whether expenses were "habitual or normal in the sense that the taxpayer will make them often."
B: This is incorrect. While industry norms can be relevant in some tax contexts, this wasn't Cardoza's definition of "ordinary" in this landmark case.
C: This is correct. Justice Cardoza established that the test for whether an expense is "ordinary" hinges on whether "the payment is customarily made in the given circumstances." This definition focuses on the appropriateness of the expense within its context rather than its frequency.
D: This is incorrect. While reasonableness is a separate requirement for business expense deductibility, it wasn't part of Cardoza's definition of "ordinary" in Welch v. Helvering.

Chunk 2 (pages 23-41): This section covers various tax deductions and their limitations, including landmark court cases that established the "ordinary and necessary" test for business expenses, specialized deductions for educators and self-employed individuals, retirement account contributions, and the treatment of various types of interest expenses. The material emphasizes the importance of understanding when and how expenses can be deducted, particularly highlighting changes in tax treatment based on timing (as with alimony) and the specific limitations that apply to different categories of deductions.

Chunk 3 (pages 42-59): This section covers various tax deductions and credits, including charitable contribution rules with specific limitations based on property type and recipient organization, casualty and theft loss deductions (now limited primarily to federally declared disasters), hobby loss rules, and valuable energy-related tax credits that incentivize residential clean energy investments and electric vehicle purchases. Understanding the specific requirements, limitations, and documentation needed for each type of deduction or credit is essential for effective tax planning.
