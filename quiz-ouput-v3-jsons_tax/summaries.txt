Chunk 1: The R&D tax credit is a valuable incentive for businesses engaged in innovation, providing approximately 8.5% credit at the federal level plus additional state-level benefits in 37 states. The credit applies to businesses developing new products, processes, software, or formulas using scientific methods to overcome technical uncertainties. Recent and upcoming changes include a controversial requirement to capitalize R&D expenses (expected to be reversed in 2025), increased documentation requirements for refund claims, and evolving IRS audit approaches. Companies can use the credit to offset income tax or, in certain circumstances for startups, payroll taxes.
