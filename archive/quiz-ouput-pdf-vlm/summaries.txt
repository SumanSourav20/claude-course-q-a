Chunk 1 (pages 4-31): **Explanation:** Justice Cardoza established a critical precedent in Welch v. Helvering when he defined "ordinary" expenses. He clarified that an expense need not be "habitual or normal in the sense that the taxpayer will make them often." Instead, the test is "whether the payment is customarily made in the given circumstances." This definition has guided tax courts in distinguishing between deductible ordinary expenses and non-deductible capital expenditures. The Geodel and Greenspan cases further illustrate this principleâ€”courts examine whether similarly situated businesses would typically incur such expenses under comparable circumstances, rather than focusing on frequency or commonality alone.

Chunk 2 (pages 32-59): This section of the course covers various individual tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers, including IRA contributions, medical and dental expenses, charitable donations, and energy-related tax incentives. The material explains the specific qualification requirements, limitations, and calculations for each deduction and credit, highlighting the technical distinctions between similar provisions (such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit versus the Residential Clean Energy Credit). It also details the complex hierarchical structure of charitable contribution limitations based on the type of property donated and the receiving organization.
