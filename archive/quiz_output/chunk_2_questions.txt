## Quiz Questions on Tax Deductions and Expenses

### Question 1 (00:27:13-00:28:10)
What did Justice Cardoza state about the test for determining ordinary business expenses?

A: The test is whether expenses are habitual and made often by the taxpayer
B: The test is whether the payment is customarily made in the given circumstance
C: The test is whether the expense is necessary for generating revenue

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
A: Incorrect. Justice Cardoza specifically stated that the test was "not whether expenses were habitual or normal in the sense that the taxpayer will make them often."
B: Correct. Justice Cardoza stated that the test is "whether the payment is customarily made in the given circumstance," emphasizing the context of the expense rather than its frequency.
C: Incorrect. While necessity is part of business expense requirements, this wasn't part of Justice Cardoza's specific statement about what constitutes "ordinary" expenses.

What is the primary purpose of the "reasonable" criterion for business expenses?

A: To prevent businesses from claiming excessive travel and entertainment expenses
B: To regulate expenses between related parties
C: To ensure businesses only claim expenses that are absolutely necessary
D: To prevent taxpayers from claiming personal expenses as business deductions

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
A: Incorrect. While reasonableness applies to all expenses, the content specifically mentions that this criterion primarily regulates related-party transactions.
B: Correct. The content states that "when you take all of these together, the criterion gets...set up to regulate expenses between related parties," making this the primary purpose.
C: Incorrect. "Necessary" is a separate criterion that implies expenses must be "appropriate and helpful" but not necessarily indispensable.
D: Incorrect. While preventing personal expenses from being claimed as business is important, the content specifically identifies related-party transactions as the primary focus of the "reasonable" criterion.

D: They are automatically disallowed by the IRS during audits

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
A: Incorrect. Related-party transactions are not automatically allowed as deductions even with documentation.
B: Correct. The content explains that "any time you have a transaction between related parties, the transaction usually is not deductible by the party that pays the expense" but "the party receiving the item has income."
C: Incorrect. While they may require special reporting, the content states they are generally not deductible by the payer.
D: Incorrect. They aren't automatically disallowed during audits; rather, there are specific rules about their deductibility for the payer while still creating taxable income for the recipient.
