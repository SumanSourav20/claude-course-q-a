# Multiple Choice Questions on Tax Policy and Proposed Legislation

## Question 1 (00:04:45.00 - 00:06:16.00)
What is the current composition of the House of Representatives and why is it significant for passing tax legislation?
A) 222 Republicans to 215 Democrats, which requires bipartisan cooperation
B) 217 Republicans to 215 Democrats, representing the slimmest majority in congressional history
C) 220 Republicans to 215 Democrats, requiring five Republican votes to block legislation
D) 218 Republicans to 217 Democrats, with just enough votes to pass legislation

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. The current House composition has changed from 222-215 to 217-215 due to resignations, and the issue isn't bipartisan cooperation but maintaining the Republican majority.
B: Correct. After the resignation of several Republicans (Matt Gaetz, Walts, and soon Nik), the majority has shrunk to 217-215, which is the slimmest majority in congressional history, making it extremely difficult to pass legislation if even a few members dissent.
C: Incorrect. 220-215 is not the current composition, and while five votes would be significant, the actual margins are even tighter.
D: Incorrect. The composition is 217-215, not 218-217, though the concept of a very narrow majority is accurate.

## Question 2 (00:07:25.00 - 00:09:15.00)
Which proposal regarding the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction would be most politically feasible for passage?
A) Complete repeal of the SALT deduction
B) Maintaining the $10,000 cap but expanding it to $20,000 for married couples
C) Eliminating the state and local tax deduction for businesses
D) Eliminating only the sales tax portion of the SALT deduction

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. Complete repeal is politically infeasible because approximately 13 Republicans from California alone plus those from other high-tax states like Illinois and New York would oppose it, exceeding the slim majority margin.
B: Correct. This proposal is most feasible as it maintains the basic structure while providing relief for married couples, making it a compromise position that wouldn't alienate a critical mass of representatives.
C: Incorrect. This would significantly increase tax bills for businesses in high-tax states and would likely face strong opposition from the business community and their representatives.
D: Incorrect. This would primarily affect taxpayers in no-income tax states, which tend to be more Republican-leaning (like Florida), making it politically difficult to pass.

## Question 3 (00:09:55.00 - 00:12:05.00)
What proposed change to the home mortgage interest deduction was mentioned as a possibility in the House Ways and Means document?
A) Eliminating it entirely, similar to the original TCJA proposal
B) Reducing the cap from $750,000 to $500,000
C) Expanding it to include second homes
D) Extending the deduction to include auto loan interest

Explanation:
A: Partially correct but not the best answer. While eliminating the mortgage interest deduction entirely was mentioned, there are other proposals being considered simultaneously.
B: Correct. Reducing the cap from $750,000 to $500,000 was specifically mentioned as one of the proposals being considered, and the presenter indicated that the presence of multiple proposals suggests some change is likely.
C: Incorrect. Expanding the deduction to include second homes was not mentioned as a proposal.
D: Incorrect. While adding an auto loan interest deduction was mentioned separately, it was not presented as a modification to the home mortgage interest deduction.

## Question 4 (00:11:40.00 - 00:13:45.00)
Which of the following proposed tax changes would likely face the least political resistance?
A) Eliminating the head of household filing status
B) Canceling the amortization requirement for R&D expenses
C) Making scholarship and fellowship income taxable
D) Removing the Student Loan Interest Deduction

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. Eliminating head of household status would significantly increase taxes for single parents and others who qualify, creating substantial political pushback.
B: Correct. The presenter noted that canceling amortization of R&D expenses is something "everyone on every side of the aisle has been asking for" but hasn't been included in any bill yet, suggesting broad support.
C: Incorrect. Making scholarship income taxable would create significant opposition from students, educational institutions, and families, plus would require complex changes to withholding systems.
D: Incorrect. With widespread student loan debt concerns, removing this deduction would face significant resistance, especially given recent focus on student loan relief.

## Question 5 (00:18:25.00 - 00:21:00.00)
What observation did the presenters make about the current tax filing season?
A) Clients are submitting tax documents earlier than in previous years
B) IRS delays have accelerated the filing process for most practitioners
C) Clients appear to be sending in information more slowly than last year
D) The implementation of AI has significantly reduced processing times

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. One presenter noted that clients seem to be submitting information more slowly, not earlier.
B: Incorrect. The discussion suggested that IRS delays and the late start to filing season (January 27) might be contributing to slower submissions, not acceleration.
C: Correct. Nick specifically mentioned, "I'm finding clients are getting stuff in slower" and noted feeling behind compared to last year in terms of work received.
D: Incorrect. While AI was discussed as a tool being used to find new processes, there was no claim that it had already significantly reduced processing times.

## Key Concepts Summary
The discussion primarily focused on potential tax legislation changes under the slim Republican House majority. With only a two-vote margin after recent resignations, any tax bill will require near-unanimous Republican support. Proposed changes range from modifications to SALT deductions and mortgage interest caps to more controversial ideas like eliminating certain tax credits and education-related deductions. Understanding these potential changes is vital for tax professionals to help clients prepare for possible tax implications in upcoming years.

C) Starting to process tax returns earlier than usual
D) Extending all client returns automatically

Explanation:

B) Completely eliminated by Supreme Court ruling
C) On hold and currently a voluntary filing

B: Incorrect. While the Supreme Court ruled on one term of law related to BOI, it did not completely eliminate it.
C: Correct. The speaker explains that due to ongoing legal challenges, BOI "is on hold and it is a voluntary filing" currently, with final determination expected around April.
D: Incorrect. There's no mention of it only applying to companies with international operations.

A) Using complex tax projections for each quarter
B) Setting up monthly payment plans for all clients

D) Advising clients to wait for potential tax law changes

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. The speaker doesn't recommend complex quarterly projections.
B: Incorrect. Monthly payment plans aren't mentioned as a recommendation.
C: Correct. The speaker states "I'm killing it on the safe harbors. Every client is gonna get a safe harbor estimate, and that way they know what it is to avoid any penalties" due to potential tax law changes.
D: Incorrect. Rather than waiting, the speaker recommends being proactive with safe harbor calculations.

## Question 4 (00:29:20-00:30:42)
According to the speaker, what service are clients increasingly interested in beyond basic tax preparation?
A) Bookkeeping services
B) Tax planning
C) Audit representation
D) Business consulting

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. While bookkeeping might be valuable, it wasn't identified as the service clients are increasingly requesting.
B: Correct. The speaker cites studies showing that "70% of clients said, 'I wish I had more tax planning'" and would even be willing to pay for it, making it a good opportunity for practice growth.
C: Incorrect. Audit representation wasn't mentioned as a service clients are increasingly requesting.
D: Incorrect. Business consulting wasn't identified as the primary service clients are seeking.

## Question 5 (00:39:40-00:42:13)
What two primary criteria should tax professionals use to determine if an expense qualifies as a deductible medical expense?
A) Whether it's prescribed by a doctor and covered by insurance
B) Whether it's medically necessary and federally legal
C) Whether it exceeds 7.5% of AGI and was paid in cash
D) Whether it's for preventative care and FDA-approved

Explanation:
A: Incorrect. While doctor prescriptions may be relevant, insurance coverage is not a determining factor.
B: Correct. The speaker explicitly states that deductible medical expenses must be both "medically necessary" and "federally legal" to qualify.
C: Incorrect. The 7.5% AGI threshold determines when medical expenses become deductible, but isn't a criterion for whether an expense qualifies as medical.
D: Incorrect. Preventative care may qualify but this isn't mentioned as a primary criterion, and FDA approval is not discussed.
