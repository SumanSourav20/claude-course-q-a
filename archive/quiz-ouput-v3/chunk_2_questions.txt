# Tax Deductions and Credits Quiz Questions

## Question 1 (00:43:39 - 00:45:58)
What is true about IRA contribution deadlines for tax purposes?

A) IRA contributions can be made until the extended due date if a taxpayer files an extension
B) IRA contributions must be made by April 15th (the due date of the return without extensions)
C) IRA contributions follow the same deadline rules as qualified plans
D) IRA contributions must be made by December 31st of the tax year

Explanation:
A: This is incorrect. As explained in the content, if you put a return on extension, you do not get an extension for the IRA contribution deadline.
B: This is correct. IRA contributions must be made by the due date of the return without regard to extensions, which is April 15th for most tax years (or the next business day if April 15th falls on a weekend or holiday).
C: This is incorrect. Unlike qualified plans or SEP plans where contributions can be made until the tax return is filed (including extensions), IRA contributions have a strict April 15th deadline.
D: This is incorrect. The deadline for IRA contributions is not December 31st but April 15th of the following year.

## Question 2 (00:46:57 - 00:48:06)
What is the maximum student loan interest deduction available for taxpayers in 2024, and what happens when a married filing jointly couple's AGI exceeds $200,000?

A) $2,500 maximum deduction; no deduction is allowed when AGI exceeds $200,000
B) $2,500 maximum deduction; a partial deduction is allowed when AGI exceeds $200,000
C) $1,200 maximum deduction; no deduction is allowed when AGI exceeds $200,000
D) $2,000 maximum deduction; a partial deduction is phased out between $170,000-$200,000

Explanation:
A: This is correct. Taxpayers can deduct up to $2,500 of interest paid on qualified educational loans in 2024, but once a married filing jointly couple's AGI exceeds $200,000, the student loan interest deduction is completely eliminated.
B: This is incorrect. While $2,500 is the maximum deduction, there is no partial deduction allowed when AGI exceeds $200,000 for married filing jointly couples - the deduction is completely eliminated.
C: This is incorrect. The maximum student loan interest deduction is $2,500, not $1,200.
D: This is incorrect. Though there is a phase-out range between $170,000-$200,000, the maximum deduction is $2,500, not $2,000.

## Question 3 (00:51:33 - 00:53:41)
Regarding qualified residence interest deductions, what is the current limitation on mortgage debt for deduction purposes?

A) Interest is deductible on up to $1 million of acquisition indebtedness for a primary residence
B) Interest is deductible on up to $750,000 of acquisition and home equity indebtedness combined 
C) Interest is deductible on up to $750,000 of acquisition indebtedness and another $100,000 of home equity debt
D) Interest is deductible on unlimited mortgage debt as long as it's for a qualified residence

Explanation:
A: This is incorrect. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the previous $1 million limit to $750,000.
B: This is correct. Qualified residence interest is deductible on no more than $750,000 of the sum of acquisition and home equity indebtedness ($375,000 for married filing separately).
C: This is incorrect. The additional $100,000 allowance for home equity debt that existed prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is no longer separately available; the total combined limit is $750,000.
D: This is incorrect. There is a clear limitation of $750,000 on the amount of debt that can qualify for the mortgage interest deduction.

## Question 4 (00:56:57 - 01:01:01)
What is the overall limitation on charitable contributions as a percentage of AGI, and how long can excess contributions be carried forward?

A) 50% of AGI; excess contributions can be carried forward for 3 years
B) 60% of AGI; excess contributions can be carried forward for 5 years
C) 50% of AGI; excess contributions can be carried forward for 5 years
D) 30% of AGI; excess contributions can be carried forward indefinitely

Explanation:
A: This is incorrect. While 50% of AGI is the traditional overall limitation, the carryforward period is 5 years, not 3 years.
B: This is partially correct but ultimately incorrect. While there is a temporary increase to 60% of AGI for cash contributions to certain charities, the permanent rule is 50% of AGI, and the carryforward period is correctly stated as 5 years.
C: This is correct. The overall limitation on charitable deductions is generally 50% of AGI (with temporary increases to 60% in some cases), and any donations that exceed this limitation can be carried forward and deducted within the next five-year period. After five years, any remaining excess is lost.
D: This is incorrect. While 30% limitations apply to certain types of contributions (such as capital gain property), the overall limitation is 50% of AGI, not 30%.

## Question 5 (01:19:30 - 01:23:05)
Regarding the Clean Vehicle Credit (EV credit) for electric vehicles placed in service after 2022, what are the two components that make up the maximum $7,500 credit?

A) $3,750 for domestic manufacturing and $3,750 for meeting emissions standards
B) $3,750 for domestic content of battery components and $3,750 for domestic sourcing of critical minerals
C) $3,750 for battery capacity and $3,750 for vehicle weight classification
D) $5,000 for domestic manufacturing and $2,500 for meeting emissions standards

Explanation:
A: This is incorrect. While domestic manufacturing is related, the specific components are different from what's stated here.
B: This is correct. The credit has two specific components: $3,750 applies if the vehicle satisfies the domestic content test for critical minerals in the battery, and another $3,750 applies if the vehicle satisfies the domestic content requirements for battery components.
C: This is incorrect. Battery capacity and vehicle weight are not the determining factors for the two components of the credit.
D: This is incorrect. The credit is split into two equal parts of $3,750 each, not $5,000 and $2,500.

# Key Concepts Summary

This section covered detailed aspects of tax deductions and credits, including IRA contribution rules and deadlines, student loan interest deduction limitations, and residential mortgage interest deduction rules. It also examined charitable contribution limitations and carryforward provisions. Finally, it introduced newer tax credits from recent legislation, particularly focusing on energy efficiency improvements and electric vehicle credits that provide dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax liability rather than just reducing taxable income.
