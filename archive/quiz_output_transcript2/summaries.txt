Chunk 1: **Explanation:** For 2024, the base contribution limit for family coverage to a Health Savings Account (HSA) is $7,500. However, individuals who have reached age 55 are allowed an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution each. Therefore, when both spouses are 55 or older, they can each make the additional $1,000 catch-up contribution, bringing the total maximum allowable contribution to $9,500 ($7,500 base + $1,000 + $1,000).

Chunk 2: This section covered critical aspects of tax planning through deductions and credits. Key topics included the tax treatment of alimony based on when divorce agreements were executed, rules governing IRA contributions including compensation requirements and timing, and the complex limitations on charitable contributions. The section also explained how the IRS distinguishes businesses from hobbies and introduced several newer tax credits related to energy efficiency, home improvements, and electric vehicles that were created through recent legislation. Understanding these deductions and credits is essential for minimizing tax liability while remaining compliant with tax laws.
