Question 1 (Pages 9-10): What is the foundation for allowing tax deductions according to the presentation?
A. Constitutional right
B. Legislative grace
C. Court precedent
D. Taxpayer election

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: Page 10 explicitly states "There is no constitutional right to a deduction." Tax deductions are not guaranteed by the Constitution but exist solely through legislation.
B. Correct: Page 10 specifically states that "Deductions are said to be a matter of legislative grace and are allowed solely at the discretion of Congress." This indicates that deductions exist only because Congress has chosen to create them.
C. Incorrect: The presentation does not identify court precedent as the foundation for tax deductions. Courts may interpret tax law, but the foundational authority for deductions comes from legislative action by Congress.
D. Incorrect: The presentation does not support the notion that taxpayers can elect or choose which deductions they receive independent of legislative authorization. Deductions are determined by Congress, not by taxpayer preference or choice.

Question 2 (Page 11): According to the presentation, which of the following statements about tax deductions is most accurate?
A. All deductions must be specifically identified in the tax code
B. The cost of living expenses are generally deductible
C. Costs of earning a living are ordinarily deductible in full
D. Personal expenses are generally more deductible than business expenses

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: Page 11 explicitly states "Deductions do not necessarily need to be identified specifically in the Code before a deduction is allowed." This indicates that some deductions may be allowable even without specific identification in the tax code.
B. Incorrect: Page 11 states clearly that "The cost of living are generally not deductible." This contradicts the statement in this option.
C. Correct: Page 11 directly states that "the costs of earning a living are ordinarily deductible in full." This reflects the tax principle that legitimate business expenses can typically be deducted.
D. Incorrect: The presentation indicates the opposite relationship. Page 11 notes that "The cost of living are generally not deductible," which suggests personal expenses are less likely to be deductible than business expenses.

Question 3 (Pages 15-16): What criteria must expenses meet to be allowable business deductions?
A. They must be personal, related to profit, and paid during the taxable year
B. They must be ordinary, necessary, reasonable, and incurred for business
C. They must be specifically identified in the tax code and incurred for personal purposes
D. They must be unusual, reasonable, and approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: Personal expenses are generally not deductible according to the presentation. Business deductions must relate to business purposes, not personal ones.
B. Correct: Page 15 outlines that allowable deductions must be sufficiently related to carrying on a trade or business, must be ordinary and necessary, must be reasonable, and must be paid or incurred during the taxable year.
C. Incorrect: The presentation states that deductions do not necessarily need to be identified specifically in the Code, and personal expenses are generally not deductible rather than being a requirement.
D. Incorrect: Business expenses should be "ordinary" rather than unusual to qualify for deduction. There is no requirement mentioned about IRS pre-approval for standard business deductions.

Question 4 (Pages 17-18): What was the outcome of Conway Twitty's tax case regarding his reimbursements to investors in his failed Twitty Burger business?
A. The IRS allowed the deduction because it enhanced his reputation as a musician
B. The court ruled the reimbursements were personal expenses and not deductible
C. The court held the payments were deductible business expenses
D. The IRS denied the deduction because food businesses are unrelated to music careers

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: The presentation does not indicate that the IRS allowed the deduction or that the reasoning was related to enhancing his reputation as a musician.
B. Incorrect: This contradicts the actual outcome of the case. The court did not rule that the reimbursements were personal expenses.
C. Correct: Page 18 indicates that the court ultimately ruled in Conway Twitty's favor, holding that his payments to investors were deductible business expenses, not merely personal moral obligations.
D. Incorrect: The presentation does not state that the IRS denied the deduction based on food businesses being unrelated to music careers. The issue centered on whether the reimbursements were business or personal in nature.

Question 5 (Pages 19-20): How should expenses with both personal and business elements be treated for tax purposes?
A. They are fully deductible regardless of the personal element
B. They are never deductible under any circumstances
C. A portion of the expense should be allocated to each purpose
D. Only expenses that are 100% business-related qualify for deduction

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: The presentation does not support full deductibility of mixed-purpose expenses regardless of the personal element.
B. Incorrect: The presentation does not state that mixed-purpose expenses are categorically non-deductible in all circumstances.
C. Correct: Page 19 explicitly states that "If the expense has both personal and business elements, allocate a portion of the expense to each." This indicates that mixed expenses should be appropriately divided between business and personal components.
D. Incorrect: The presentation acknowledges that expenses can have both personal and business elements and still qualify for partial deduction. It does not limit deductions to only 100% business-related expenses.

Question 1 (Page 24): What does "necessary" mean in the context of business expense deductibility?
A. The expense must be indispensable or unavoidable
B. The expense must be "appropriate and helpful"
C. The expense must be required by law or regulation
D. The expense must be common in the industry

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: The tax code does not require business expenses to be indispensable or unavoidable to qualify as necessary. This is a misinterpretation of the "necessary" requirement.
B. Correct: In tax law, "necessary" means that expenses must be "appropriate and helpful" for the business, establishing a more flexible standard than requiring expenses to be absolutely essential.
C. Incorrect: Legal or regulatory requirements are not part of the definition of "necessary" for business expense deductibility. Many deductible business expenses are optional under the law.
D. Incorrect: While industry norms may be relevant when evaluating the reasonableness of an expense, they do not define what makes an expense "necessary" for tax deduction purposes.

Question 2 (Page 26): What is the maximum contribution limit for a Health Savings Account (HSA) in 2024 for a family with both spouses age 55 or older?
A. $3,850
B. $4,850
C. $7,750
D. $9,950

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: $3,850 is the base contribution limit for self-only HSA coverage in 2024, not the limit for family coverage with age-based additions.
B. Incorrect: $4,850 represents the self-only HSA contribution limit for individuals age 55 or older ($3,850 base + $1,000 catch-up), not the family limit.
C. Incorrect: $7,750 is the base family coverage HSA contribution limit for 2024, but this amount does not include the additional catch-up contributions allowed for taxpayers age 55 or older.
D. Correct: For family HSA coverage with both spouses age 55 or older, the maximum contribution is $9,950 in 2024, which includes the $7,750 base family contribution plus $1,100 additional contribution for each spouse age 55 or older ($1,100 Ã— 2 = $2,200).

Question 3 (Page 28): What is the maximum annual contribution limit to a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan for self-employed individuals in 2024?
A. 20% of self-employment earnings
B. The lesser of 25% of self-employment earnings or $69,000
C. $69,000 minus self-employment taxes
D. $69,000 regardless of earnings

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: While 20% is used as a standard calculation rate for convenience, it is not the actual maximum contribution limit specified in tax regulations for SEP plans.
B. Correct: The maximum annual contribution to a SEP plan in 2024 is limited to the lesser of 25% of self-employment earnings or $69,000. Self-employment earnings are first reduced by the deductible portion of self-employment taxes.
C. Incorrect: The calculation for maximum SEP contributions involves reducing self-employment earnings by the deductible portion of self-employment taxes, but the limit is not simply $69,000 minus these taxes.
D. Incorrect: The $69,000 limit is not an absolute amount that can be contributed regardless of earnings. The contribution is limited by the 25% of earnings rule, which may result in a maximum contribution below $69,000.

Question 4 (Page 31): How is alimony treated for divorces executed after 2018?
A. Alimony is gross income to the recipient and deductible by the payor
B. Alimony is taxable to the recipient but not deductible by the payor
C. Alimony is nondeductible to the payor and not included in the gross income of the recipient
D. Alimony treatment depends on the terms specified in the divorce agreement

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: For divorces executed before 2019, alimony was treated as gross income to the recipient and deductible by the payor, but this treatment does not apply to divorces executed after 2018.
B. Incorrect: This tax treatment is not applicable to alimony under current tax law for divorces executed after 2018. The tax burden is not split between parties in this manner.
C. Correct: For divorces executed or modified after 2018, alimony payments are nondeductible to the payor and are not included in the gross income of the recipient. This represents a significant change in the tax treatment of alimony.
D. Incorrect: The tax treatment of alimony is determined by when the divorce was executed or modified, not by specific terms within the divorce agreement itself. The timing is the controlling factor.

Question 5 (Pages 39-40): What limitation applies to the deductibility of investment interest expense?
A. It is limited to $10,000 for single filers and $20,000 for married filing jointly
B. It may be deducted only to the extent of net investment income
C. It is limited to 7.5% of adjusted gross income
D. It is fully deductible as an itemized deduction without limitation

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: The $10,000/$20,000 limitation applies to state and local tax deductions, not to investment interest expense. Investment interest has a different limitation structure.
B. Correct: Investment interest expense is deductible only to the extent of the taxpayer's net investment income, which is calculated as investment income minus investment expenses. This creates a ceiling on how much investment interest can be deducted in a given tax year.
C. Incorrect: The 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI) threshold applies to medical expense deductions. This percentage represents the floor that medical expenses must exceed to be deductible, not a limitation on investment interest.
D. Incorrect: Investment interest expense is not fully deductible without limitations. It is subject to the net investment income limitation, which may restrict the amount that can be deducted in the current tax year.

Question 1 (Pages 45-46): What special limitation applies to capital gain property donated to 50% limit organizations if the donor elects not to reduce the fair market value of the donated property?
A. 20% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation
B. 30% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation
C. 50% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation
D. 60% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: The 20% of AGI limitation applies specifically to capital gain property donated to non-50% limit organizations. This limitation is not applicable when donating capital gain property to 50% limit organizations with an election not to reduce fair market value.
B. Correct: When a donor contributes capital gain property to 50% limit organizations (such as churches, educational organizations, and hospitals) and elects not to reduce the fair market value by the amount that would have been long-term capital gain if the property had been sold, a special 30% of AGI limitation applies to these donations.
C. Incorrect: The 50% of AGI limitation is the general limitation for charitable contributions to 50% limit organizations, but this limit does not apply to capital gain property when the donor elects not to reduce the fair market value. For capital gain property with such an election, a more restrictive 30% limitation applies.
D. Incorrect: The 60% of AGI limitation applies specifically to cash contributions to 50% limit organizations. This limitation does not apply to donations of capital gain property under any circumstances.

Question 2 (Pages 50-51): How are disaster losses that qualify for tax deduction treated differently from regular casualty losses?
A. Disaster losses are not subject to the $100 floor
B. Disaster losses exceeding $100 plus 10% of AGI are deductible
C. Disaster losses must be claimed in the year they occurred
D. Disaster losses are not considered itemized deductions

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: Disaster losses are subject to a $100 floor, just like regular casualty losses. Only amounts exceeding this $100 threshold are deductible.
B. Correct: Disaster losses that exceed $100 plus 10% of AGI are deductible as itemized deductions on Schedule A. In contrast, regular personal casualty and theft losses are limited to offsetting casualty gains, with only the aggregate amount exceeding 10% of AGI being deductible.
C. Incorrect: Taxpayers with disaster losses have flexibility in when they claim the deduction. They can choose to deduct the loss either on the return for the year in which the loss occurred or on the preceding year's return by filing an amended return.
D. Incorrect: Disaster losses are claimed as itemized deductions on Schedule A, just like other personal casualty losses. They are not excluded from the itemized deduction category.

Question 3 (Page 51): According to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criteria, when is an activity involving breeding, training, showing, or racing horses presumed not to be a hobby?
A. If profits result in any 3 of 5 consecutive tax years
B. If profits result in any 2 of 7 consecutive tax years
C. If profits result in any 4 of 7 consecutive tax years
D. If profits result in any 2 of 5 consecutive tax years

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: The profit test requiring profits in any 3 of 5 consecutive tax years applies to most activities, but the IRS has a different standard specifically for horse-related activities.
B. Correct: For activities involving breeding, training, showing, or racing horses, the IRS presumes the activity is not a hobby if profits result in any 2 of 7 consecutive tax years. This is a special profit test that applies only to horse-related activities.
C. Incorrect: There is no IRS profit test requiring profits in any 4 of 7 consecutive tax years for any type of activity, including horse-related activities.
D. Incorrect: This profit test does not exist in IRS guidelines. For horse-related activities, the standard is 2 of 7 consecutive tax years, and for most other activities, the standard is 3 of 5 consecutive tax years.

Question 4 (Pages 53-54): What is the maximum annual limit for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit for most qualified energy property improvements?
A. $600
B. $1,200
C. $2,000
D. $3,000

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: While $600 is the annual limit for certain individual categories of qualified energy property (such as exterior windows and skylights), it is not the maximum total annual credit amount allowed for all improvements combined.
B. Correct: The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit has a maximum annual limit of $1,200 for most qualified energy property improvements. This is the general cap that applies to the total credit amount across various categories of improvements.
C. Incorrect: The $2,000 amount is an additional credit limit specifically for electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves and boilers, not the general maximum credit amount for most energy-efficient improvements.
D. Incorrect: The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit does not have a $3,000 maximum annual limit for any category or combination of improvements.

Question 5 (Page 57): What are the two components of the New Clean Vehicle Credit (EV credit) available for qualified vehicles placed in service after 2022 and before 2033?
A. A $3,750 credit for domestic manufacturing and a $3,750 credit for energy efficiency
B. A $3,750 credit for domestic mineral content and a $3,750 credit for domestic battery components
C. A $5,000 credit for electric vehicles and a $2,500 credit for hybrid vehicles
D. A $5,000 credit for American-made vehicles and a $2,500 credit for foreign vehicles with domestic components

Explanation:
A. Incorrect: The New Clean Vehicle Credit is not divided into components based on domestic manufacturing and energy efficiency. The credit has different qualification criteria.
B. Correct: The New Clean Vehicle Credit consists of two equal components: a $3,750 credit available if the vehicle meets requirements for critical minerals sourced domestically or from countries with free trade agreements, and another $3,750 credit if the vehicle meets requirements for battery components manufactured or assembled in North America.
C. Incorrect: The New Clean Vehicle Credit is not structured with different amounts for electric versus hybrid vehicles. The total possible credit of $7,500 applies to qualifying vehicles regardless of whether they are fully electric or hybrid.
D. Incorrect: The credit does not provide $5,000 for American-made vehicles and $2,500 for foreign vehicles with domestic components. The credit structure is based on specific criteria related to battery minerals and components, not the overall vehicle manufacturing location.
