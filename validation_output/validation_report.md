### Chunk 1 (Pages 4 to 22)
- Questions in chunk: 5
- Questions with issues: 3

#### Question 3 (Pages 15-16)

**Issues detected:**
- I cannot fully validate this question as pages 15-16 are not included in the provided slides. The question references criteria for allowable deductions that should be on these pages.
- Without seeing the specific content on pages 15-16, I cannot confirm whether the explanations accurately reflect the presentation content.

#### Question 4 (Pages 17-18)

**Issues detected:**
- I cannot validate this question as pages 17-18 are not included in the provided slides. The question references a Conway Twitty tax case that should be discussed on these pages.
- Without seeing the specific content on pages 17-18, I cannot confirm whether the explanations accurately reflect the presentation content.

#### Question 5 (Pages 19-20)

**Issues detected:**
- I cannot validate this question as pages 19-20 are not included in the provided slides. The question references how to treat expenses with both personal and business elements.
- Without seeing the specific content on pages 19-20, I cannot confirm whether the explanations accurately reflect the presentation content.
- In summary:
- Questions 1 and 2 appear to be valid and well-constructed based on the content shown.
- Questions 3, 4, and 5 cannot be fully validated as the relevant slides (pages 15-20) were not provided in the images.

### Chunk 2 (Pages 23 to 41)
- Questions in chunk: 5
- Questions with issues: 2

#### Question 2 (Pages 26-27)

**Issues detected:**
- The explanation for option D contains incorrect information. The slide on page 26 states that for family coverage, the limit is "$7,750 ($9,950 for taxpayer who have both reached age 55)" which indicates a total additional amount of $2,200 for two spouses age 55+, not $1,100 per spouse as stated in the explanation.
- The question asks about "a family with both spouses age 55 or older" but the slide text refers to "taxpayer who have both reached age 55" which creates potential ambiguity about whether this is referring to two individuals or something else.

#### Question 5 (Pages 39-40)

**Issues detected:**
- The image files provided don't include pages 39-40, so I cannot verify the accuracy of this question against the source material.
- The page numbers referenced in the question (Pages 39-40) don't match the provided images which only go up to page 32.

### Chunk 3 (Pages 42 to 59)
- Questions in chunk: 5
- Questions with issues: 4

#### Question 1 (Pages 45-46)

**Issues detected:**
- The explanations for incorrect options contain references to the correct answer:
  - Option A explanation: "The 20% limitation applies to capital gain property donated to non-50% limit charities, not to 50% limit organizations when the donor elects not to reduce fair market value." This compares to what the correct answer covers.
  - Option C explanation: "The 50% limitation applies to charitable contributions generally, but not specifically to capital gain property donated to 50% limit organizations when the donor elects not to reduce fair market value." This contrasts with what would make the answer correct.
  - Option D explanation: "The 60% limitation applies specifically to cash contributions, not to capital gain property donations." This uses comparative language.

#### Question 2 (Pages 50-51)

**Issues detected:**
- The question is unclear about what distinguishes disaster losses from regular casualty losses based on the material shown
- The explanations for incorrect options contain forbidden phrases and comparative language:
  - Option A explanation contains comparative language: "Disaster losses are still subject to a $100 floor, similar to other casualty losses."
  - Option C explanation: "Taxpayers have the option of deducting the loss on the return for the year in which the loss occurred or the preceding year's return by filing an amended return." This contradicts what page 50 actually shows, which supports option C as potentially correct.
  - Option D explanation contains comparative language: "Disaster losses are claimed on Schedule A as an itemized deduction, similar to other personal casualty losses."
- Based on page 50, option B appears incorrect as the document states "Disaster losses exceeding $100 plus 10% of AGI are deductible" which is different from what's described as the correct answer.

#### Question 4 (Pages 53-54)

**Issues detected:**
- The referenced pages (53-54) are not included in the provided images, making it impossible to validate this question against source material
- The explanation for option C contains comparative language: "While a taxpayer may claim an additional $2,000 annual credit for electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves and boilers, this is not the general maximum credit amount."

#### Question 5 (Page 57)

**Issues detected:**
- The referenced page (57) is not included in the provided images, making it impossible to validate this question against source material
- The explanations for incorrect options contain comparative language:
  - Option A explanation: "The credit components are not based on domestic manufacturing and energy efficiency specifically."
  - Option C explanation: "The credit is not divided between electric and hybrid vehicles in this manner."
  - Option D explanation: "The credit is not structured with a $5,000 credit for American-made vehicles and a $2,500 credit for foreign vehicles with domestic components."
