# Detailed Changes Report

## Question 1 (Chunk 1)

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation explicitly states on page 10 that "There is no constitutional right to a deduction."
- After: Incorrect: Page 10 explicitly states "There is no constitutional right to a deduction." Tax deductions are not guaranteed by the Constitution but exist solely through legislation.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: On page 10, the presentation specifically states that "Deductions are said to be a matter of legislative grace and are allowed solely at the discretion of Congress."
- After: Correct: Page 10 specifically states that "Deductions are said to be a matter of legislative grace and are allowed solely at the discretion of Congress." This indicates that deductions exist only because Congress has chosen to create them.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: While courts interpret tax law, the presentation indicates that deductions are fundamentally a matter of legislative grace, not court precedent.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation does not identify court precedent as the foundation for tax deductions. Courts may interpret tax law, but the foundational authority for deductions comes from legislative action by Congress.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The taxpayer does not have the authority to elect deductions; they are permitted only as allowed by Congress as a matter of legislative grace.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation does not support the notion that taxpayers can elect or choose which deductions they receive independent of legislative authorization. Deductions are determined by Congress, not by taxpayer preference or choice.


## Question 2 (Chunk 1)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** According to the presentation, which of the following statements about tax deductions is true?

**After:** According to the presentation, which of the following statements about tax deductions is most accurate?

### Options Changed

**Option D:**
- Before: Deductions always require explicit statutory provisions
- After: Personal expenses are generally more deductible than business expenses

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation states that "Deductions do not necessarily need to be identified specifically in the Code before a deduction is allowed."
- After: Incorrect: Page 11 explicitly states "Deductions do not necessarily need to be identified specifically in the Code before a deduction is allowed." This indicates that some deductions may be allowable even without specific identification in the tax code.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation clearly states that "The cost of living are generally not deductible."
- After: Incorrect: Page 11 states clearly that "The cost of living are generally not deductible." This contradicts the statement in this option.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Correct: The presentation states that "the costs of earning a living are ordinarily deductible in full."
- After: Correct: Page 11 directly states that "the costs of earning a living are ordinarily deductible in full." This reflects the tax principle that legitimate business expenses can typically be deducted.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation indicates that deductions don't necessarily need explicit identification in the Code, contradicting this statement.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation indicates the opposite relationship. Page 11 notes that "The cost of living are generally not deductible," which suggests personal expenses are less likely to be deductible than business expenses.


## Question 3 (Chunk 1)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** What criteria must expenses meet to be allowable deductions?

**After:** What criteria must expenses meet to be allowable business deductions?

### Options Changed

**Option B:**
- Before: They must be reasonable, ordinary, necessary, and incurred for business
- After: They must be ordinary, necessary, reasonable, and incurred for business

**Option D:**
- Before: They must be unusual, reasonable, and approved by the IRS
- After: They must be unusual, reasonable, and approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: According to page 16, ยง262 specifically prohibits personal expenses from being deductible, except those specifically allowed.
- After: Incorrect: Personal expenses are generally not deductible according to the presentation. Business deductions must relate to business purposes, not personal ones.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: Page 15 lists the requirements for allowable deductions: expenses must be sufficiently related to carrying on a trade or business, must be ordinary and necessary, must be reasonable, and must be paid or incurred during the taxable year.
- After: Correct: Page 15 outlines that allowable deductions must be sufficiently related to carrying on a trade or business, must be ordinary and necessary, must be reasonable, and must be paid or incurred during the taxable year.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation states that deductions do not necessarily need to be identified specifically in the Code, and personal expenses are generally not deductible.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation states that deductions do not necessarily need to be identified specifically in the Code, and personal expenses are generally not deductible rather than being a requirement.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation indicates expenses should be ordinary (not unusual) and there is no mention of IRS approval as a criterion.
- After: Incorrect: Business expenses should be "ordinary" rather than unusual to qualify for deduction. There is no requirement mentioned about IRS pre-approval for standard business deductions.


## Question 4 (Chunk 1)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** What was the outcome of Conway Twitty's tax case regarding his failed Twitty Burger business?

**After:** What was the outcome of Conway Twitty's tax case regarding his reimbursements to investors in his failed Twitty Burger business?

### Options Changed

**Option A:**
- Before: The IRS denied his deduction because it was a personal expense
- After: The IRS allowed the deduction because it enhanced his reputation as a musician

**Option B:**
- Before: The court ruled the reimbursements were not deductible as they were moral obligations
- After: The court ruled the reimbursements were personal expenses and not deductible

**Option D:**
- Before: Twitty was denied the deduction because restaurants are not related to singing
- After: The IRS denied the deduction because food businesses are unrelated to music careers

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: The IRS did deny the deduction, but their reasoning was based on viewing it as a moral obligation, not simply as a personal expense.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation does not indicate that the IRS allowed the deduction or that the reasoning was related to enhancing his reputation as a musician.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Incorrect: While the IRS initially denied the deduction claiming it was done out of moral obligation, this was not the final outcome of the case.
- After: Incorrect: This contradicts the actual outcome of the case. The court did not rule that the reimbursements were personal expenses.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Correct: According to page 18, "Business the court held. It's deductible they feel" indicates that the court ultimately ruled that Conway Twitty's payments to investors were deductible business expenses.
- After: Correct: Page 18 indicates that the court ultimately ruled in Conway Twitty's favor, holding that his payments to investors were deductible business expenses, not merely personal moral obligations.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The case didn't hinge on whether restaurants were related to singing careers; rather it focused on whether the reimbursements were business or personal in nature.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation does not state that the IRS denied the deduction based on food businesses being unrelated to music careers. The issue centered on whether the reimbursements were business or personal in nature.


## Question 5 (Chunk 1)

### Options Changed

**Option A:**
- Before: They are never deductible under any circumstances
- After: They are fully deductible regardless of the personal element

**Option B:**
- Before: Only the personal portion is deductible
- After: They are never deductible under any circumstances

**Option D:**
- Before: They are fully deductible if the primary purpose was business
- After: Only expenses that are 100% business-related qualify for deduction

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation does not state that mixed-purpose expenses are never deductible.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation does not support full deductibility of mixed-purpose expenses regardless of the personal element.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Incorrect: The personal portion of expenses is generally not deductible, contradicting this statement.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation does not state that mixed-purpose expenses are categorically non-deductible in all circumstances.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Correct: Page 19 explicitly states, "If the expense has both personal and business elements, allocate a portion of the expense to each."
- After: Correct: Page 19 explicitly states that "If the expense has both personal and business elements, allocate a portion of the expense to each." This indicates that mixed expenses should be appropriately divided between business and personal components.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: While page 19 does state "If the primary purpose of the expense was business, the entire cost is deductible," this is only one rule. The presentation also specifies that mixed expenses should be allocated between personal and business.

Key concepts covered in this presentation include the fundamental principles of tax deductions and credits, focusing on the legislative basis for deductions and their proper classification. The material emphasizes the distinction between business and personal expenses, explaining the criteria for deductibility and the importance of proper substantiation and timing of deductions to maximize tax benefits.
- After: Incorrect: The presentation acknowledges that expenses can have both personal and business elements and still qualify for partial deduction. It does not limit deductions to only 100% business-related expenses.


## Question 1 (Chunk 2)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** According to the presentation, what does "necessary" mean in the context of business expense deductibility?

**After:** What does "necessary" mean in the context of business expense deductibility?

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation explicitly states that necessary does not imply that expenses must be indispensable or unavoidable.
- After: Incorrect: The tax code does not require business expenses to be indispensable or unavoidable to qualify as necessary. This is a misinterpretation of the "necessary" requirement.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: The presentation defines "necessary" as implying that expenses must be "appropriate and helpful" in contrast to being indispensable or unavoidable.
- After: Correct: In tax law, "necessary" means that expenses must be "appropriate and helpful" for the business, establishing a more flexible standard than requiring expenses to be absolutely essential.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation does not mention legal or regulatory requirements as the definition of "necessary" expenses.
- After: Incorrect: Legal or regulatory requirements are not part of the definition of "necessary" for business expense deductibility. Many deductible business expenses are optional under the law.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: While industry norms may be relevant to determining reasonableness, the definition of "necessary" is specifically stated as "appropriate and helpful."
- After: Incorrect: While industry norms may be relevant when evaluating the reasonableness of an expense, they do not define what makes an expense "necessary" for tax deduction purposes.


## Question 2 (Chunk 2)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** What is the maximum contribution limit for a Health Savings Account in 2024 for a family with both spouses age 55 or older?

**After:** What is the maximum contribution limit for a Health Savings Account (HSA) in 2024 for a family with both spouses age 55 or older?

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: $3,850 is the base contribution limit for self-only coverage, not for family coverage with both spouses over 55.
- After: Incorrect: $3,850 is the base contribution limit for self-only HSA coverage in 2024, not the limit for family coverage with age-based additions.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Incorrect: $4,850 is the contribution limit for self-only coverage for taxpayers who have reached age 55.
- After: Incorrect: $4,850 represents the self-only HSA contribution limit for individuals age 55 or older ($3,850 base + $1,000 catch-up), not the family limit.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: $7,750 is the base contribution limit for family coverage without considering the age-based additional contribution.
- After: Incorrect: $7,750 is the base family coverage HSA contribution limit for 2024, but this amount does not include the additional catch-up contributions allowed for taxpayers age 55 or older.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Correct: The presentation states that for family coverage, the contribution limit is $7,750 plus an additional $2,200 ($1,100 per spouse) when both spouses have reached age 55, totaling $9,950.
- After: Correct: For family HSA coverage with both spouses age 55 or older, the maximum contribution is $9,950 in 2024, which includes the $7,750 base family contribution plus $1,100 additional contribution for each spouse age 55 or older ($1,100 ร 2 = $2,200).


## Question 3 (Chunk 2)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** What is the maximum annual contribution limit to a SEP plan for self-employed individuals in 2024?

**After:** What is the maximum annual contribution limit to a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan for self-employed individuals in 2024?

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: While 20% is mentioned as a standard rate used for convenience in calculations, it is not the actual maximum contribution limit.
- After: Incorrect: While 20% is used as a standard calculation rate for convenience, it is not the actual maximum contribution limit specified in tax regulations for SEP plans.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: The presentation states that the maximum annual contribution is limited to the lesser of 25% of self-employment earnings or $69,000 in 2024.
- After: Correct: The maximum annual contribution to a SEP plan in 2024 is limited to the lesser of 25% of self-employment earnings or $69,000. Self-employment earnings are first reduced by the deductible portion of self-employment taxes.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: While self-employment earnings are reduced by the deductible part of self-employment taxes, the maximum is not simply $69,000 minus these taxes.
- After: Incorrect: The calculation for maximum SEP contributions involves reducing self-employment earnings by the deductible portion of self-employment taxes, but the limit is not simply $69,000 minus these taxes.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The $69,000 is not an absolute limit regardless of earnings; it's contingent on being the lesser of 25% of self-employment earnings or $69,000.
- After: Incorrect: The $69,000 limit is not an absolute amount that can be contributed regardless of earnings. The contribution is limited by the 25% of earnings rule, which may result in a maximum contribution below $69,000.


## Question 4 (Chunk 2)

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: This is the treatment for divorces executed before 2019, not after 2018.
- After: Incorrect: For divorces executed before 2019, alimony was treated as gross income to the recipient and deductible by the payor, but this treatment does not apply to divorces executed after 2018.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Incorrect: This does not accurately describe the treatment for divorces executed after 2018.
- After: Incorrect: This tax treatment is not applicable to alimony under current tax law for divorces executed after 2018. The tax burden is not split between parties in this manner.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Correct: The presentation clearly states that for divorces executed or modified after 2018, alimony is nondeductible to the payor and not included in the gross income of the recipient.
- After: Correct: For divorces executed or modified after 2018, alimony payments are nondeductible to the payor and are not included in the gross income of the recipient. This represents a significant change in the tax treatment of alimony.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The presentation indicates that the timing of the divorce execution determines the tax treatment, not specific terms in the agreement.
- After: Incorrect: The tax treatment of alimony is determined by when the divorce was executed or modified, not by specific terms within the divorce agreement itself. The timing is the controlling factor.


## Question 5 (Chunk 2)

### Options Changed

**Option A:**
- Before: It is limited to $10,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married filing jointly
- After: It is limited to $10,000 for single filers and $20,000 for married filing jointly

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: These limits apply to state and local tax deductions, not investment interest expense.
- After: Incorrect: The $10,000/$20,000 limitation applies to state and local tax deductions, not to investment interest expense. Investment interest has a different limitation structure.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: The presentation explicitly states that "Investment interest may be deducted only to the extent of net investment income, which is any excess of income over investment expense."
- After: Correct: Investment interest expense is deductible only to the extent of the taxpayer's net investment income, which is calculated as investment income minus investment expenses. This creates a ceiling on how much investment interest can be deducted in a given tax year.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: The 7.5% of AGI threshold applies to medical expense deductions, not investment interest.
- After: Incorrect: The 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI) threshold applies to medical expense deductions. This percentage represents the floor that medical expenses must exceed to be deductible, not a limitation on investment interest.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: Investment interest is not fully deductible without limitation; it is subject to the net investment income limitation.

Key concepts covered in this section include the principles of necessary and reasonable business expenses, specialized deductions for educators and self-employed individuals, and significant changes to tax treatment of alimony based on divorce timing. The material also provides detailed explanations of Health Savings Accounts, retirement plan contributions, and various itemized deductions including medical expenses, taxes, and investment interest.
- After: Incorrect: Investment interest expense is not fully deductible without limitations. It is subject to the net investment income limitation, which may restrict the amount that can be deducted in the current tax year.


## Question 1 (Chunk 3)

### Options Changed

**Option A:**
- Before: 20% of AGI limitation
- After: 20% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation

- After: 30% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation

**Option C:**
- Before: 50% of AGI limitation
- After: 50% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation

**Option D:**
- Before: 60% of AGI limitation
- After: 60% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) limitation

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: The 20% limitation applies to capital gain property donated to non-50% limit charities, not to 50% limit organizations when the donor elects not to reduce fair market value.
- After: Incorrect: The 20% of AGI limitation applies specifically to capital gain property donated to non-50% limit organizations. This limitation is not applicable when donating capital gain property to 50% limit organizations with an election not to reduce fair market value.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: A special 30% limitation applies to gifts of capital gain property given to 50% limit organizations when the donor elects not to reduce the fair market value by the amount that would have been long-term capital gain if the property had been sold.
- After: Correct: When a donor contributes capital gain property to 50% limit organizations (such as churches, educational organizations, and hospitals) and elects not to reduce the fair market value by the amount that would have been long-term capital gain if the property had been sold, a special 30% of AGI limitation applies to these donations.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: The 50% limitation applies to charitable contributions generally, but not specifically to capital gain property donated to 50% limit organizations when the donor elects not to reduce fair market value.
- After: Incorrect: The 50% of AGI limitation is the general limitation for charitable contributions to 50% limit organizations, but this limit does not apply to capital gain property when the donor elects not to reduce the fair market value. For capital gain property with such an election, a more restrictive 30% limitation applies.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The 60% limitation applies specifically to cash contributions, not to capital gain property donations.
- After: Incorrect: The 60% of AGI limitation applies specifically to cash contributions to 50% limit organizations. This limitation does not apply to donations of capital gain property under any circumstances.


## Question 2 (Chunk 3)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** How are disaster losses that qualify for tax deduction different from regular casualty losses?

**After:** How are disaster losses that qualify for tax deduction treated differently from regular casualty losses?

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: Disaster losses are still subject to a $100 floor, similar to other casualty losses.
- After: Incorrect: Disaster losses are subject to a $100 floor, just like regular casualty losses. Only amounts exceeding this $100 threshold are deductible.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: Disaster losses exceeding $100 plus 10% of AGI are deductible, while regular personal casualty and theft losses are limited to offsetting casualty gains and only the aggregate amount more than 10% of AGI is deductible.
- After: Correct: Disaster losses that exceed $100 plus 10% of AGI are deductible as itemized deductions on Schedule A. In contrast, regular personal casualty and theft losses are limited to offsetting casualty gains, with only the aggregate amount exceeding 10% of AGI being deductible.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: Taxpayers have the option of deducting the loss on the return for the year in which the loss occurred or the preceding year's return by filing an amended return.
- After: Incorrect: Taxpayers with disaster losses have flexibility in when they claim the deduction. They can choose to deduct the loss either on the return for the year in which the loss occurred or on the preceding year's return by filing an amended return.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: Disaster losses are claimed on Schedule A as an itemized deduction, similar to other personal casualty losses.
- After: Incorrect: Disaster losses are claimed as itemized deductions on Schedule A, just like other personal casualty losses. They are not excluded from the itemized deduction category.


## Question 3 (Chunk 3)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** According to IRS criteria, when is an activity presumed not to be a hobby if it involves breeding, training, showing, or racing horses?

**After:** According to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criteria, when is an activity involving breeding, training, showing, or racing horses presumed not to be a hobby?

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: This profit test applies to most activities, but not specifically to horse-related activities.
- After: Incorrect: The profit test requiring profits in any 3 of 5 consecutive tax years applies to most activities, but the IRS has a different standard specifically for horse-related activities.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: For breeding, training, showing, or racing horses specifically, an activity is presumed not to be a hobby if profits result in any 2 of 7 consecutive tax years.
- After: Correct: For activities involving breeding, training, showing, or racing horses, the IRS presumes the activity is not a hobby if profits result in any 2 of 7 consecutive tax years. This is a special profit test that applies only to horse-related activities.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: This is not the profit test period for horse-related activities.
- After: Incorrect: There is no IRS profit test requiring profits in any 4 of 7 consecutive tax years for any type of activity, including horse-related activities.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The standard for most activities is 3 of 5 consecutive tax years, not 2 of 5 years.
- After: Incorrect: This profit test does not exist in IRS guidelines. For horse-related activities, the standard is 2 of 7 consecutive tax years, and for most other activities, the standard is 3 of 5 consecutive tax years.


## Question 4 (Chunk 3)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** What is the maximum annual credit amount for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit for qualified energy property?

**After:** What is the maximum annual limit for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit for most qualified energy property improvements?

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: While $600 is the annual limit for any item of qualified energy property or for exterior windows and skylights, it is not the maximum total credit amount.
- After: Incorrect: While $600 is the annual limit for certain individual categories of qualified energy property (such as exterior windows and skylights), it is not the maximum total annual credit amount allowed for all improvements combined.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: The annual credit is generally limited to a maximum total credit of $1,200, with additional specific limits on various types of improvements.
- After: Correct: The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit has a maximum annual limit of $1,200 for most qualified energy property improvements. This is the general cap that applies to the total credit amount across various categories of improvements.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: While a taxpayer may claim an additional $2,000 annual credit for electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves and boilers, this is not the general maximum credit amount.
- After: Incorrect: The $2,000 amount is an additional credit limit specifically for electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves and boilers, not the general maximum credit amount for most energy-efficient improvements.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: There is no $3,000 maximum limit mentioned for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit.
- After: Incorrect: The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit does not have a $3,000 maximum annual limit for any category or combination of improvements.


## Question 5 (Chunk 3)

### Question Text Changed

**Before:** What are the two components of the New Clean Vehicle Credit (EV credit) that can be claimed for qualified vehicles placed in service after 2022 and before 2033?

**After:** What are the two components of the New Clean Vehicle Credit (EV credit) available for qualified vehicles placed in service after 2022 and before 2033?

### Explanations Changed

**Explanation A:**
- Before: Incorrect: The credit components are not based on domestic manufacturing and energy efficiency specifically.
- After: Incorrect: The New Clean Vehicle Credit is not divided into components based on domestic manufacturing and energy efficiency. The credit has different qualification criteria.

**Explanation B:**
- Before: Correct: The credit has two components: a $3,750 credit if the vehicle satisfies a domestic test for critical minerals in the battery, and another $3,750 credit if the vehicle satisfies a domestic content test for battery components, for a maximum possible credit of $7,500.
- After: Correct: The New Clean Vehicle Credit consists of two equal components: a $3,750 credit available if the vehicle meets requirements for critical minerals sourced domestically or from countries with free trade agreements, and another $3,750 credit if the vehicle meets requirements for battery components manufactured or assembled in North America.

**Explanation C:**
- Before: Incorrect: The credit is not divided between electric and hybrid vehicles in this manner.
- After: Incorrect: The New Clean Vehicle Credit is not structured with different amounts for electric versus hybrid vehicles. The total possible credit of $7,500 applies to qualifying vehicles regardless of whether they are fully electric or hybrid.

**Explanation D:**
- Before: Incorrect: The credit is not structured with a $5,000 credit for American-made vehicles and a $2,500 credit for foreign vehicles with domestic components.

Key concepts covered in this section include charitable contribution requirements and limitations, casualty and disaster loss deduction rules, hobby loss determination criteria, and various tax credits, with particular focus on energy-related tax incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, Residential Clean Energy Credit, and New Clean Vehicle Credit. The material emphasizes the specific qualifications, limitations, and calculations necessary for properly claiming these deductions and credits.
- After: Incorrect: The credit does not provide $5,000 for American-made vehicles and $2,500 for foreign vehicles with domestic components. The credit structure is based on specific criteria related to battery minerals and components, not the overall vehicle manufacturing location.
