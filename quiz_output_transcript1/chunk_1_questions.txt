# Multiple-Choice Questions on Tax Deductions and Credits

## Question 1 (00:02:19 - 00:06:20)
Which of the following statements accurately describes the relationship between deductions and the tax formula?
A) Deductions reduce tax liability directly, similar to credits
B) For AGI deductions can be taken in addition to the standard deduction
C) Itemized deductions are always more beneficial than the standard deduction
D) Credits reduce taxable income before tax rates are applied

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** In the tax formula, deductions for AGI (such as IRA contributions, SEP plans, and other retirement accounts) are taken first to arrive at Adjusted Gross Income. These deductions are available to all taxpayers regardless of whether they itemize or take the standard deduction. This means a taxpayer can take both deductions for AGI and the standard deduction, maximizing their tax benefit. Itemized deductions, on the other hand, must exceed the standard deduction to be beneficial, and credits reduce tax liability directly rather than reducing taxable income.

## Question 2 (00:15:20 - 00:17:50)
What does the term "ordinary" mean in the context of business deductions?
A) The expense must be common and accepted in the taxpayer's industry
B) The expense must be paid repeatedly every tax year
C) The expense must be required by law or regulation
D) The expense must be the most economical option available

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** As established in landmark tax cases like Welch v. Helvering, an "ordinary" expense doesn't necessarily mean that the taxpayer makes it often. Instead, it means the payment is customarily made in similar circumstances within that business context. Justice Cardoza clarified that the test is whether the expense is customarily made in the given circumstance or industry, not whether it's habitual for that particular taxpayer. The courts use this standard to deny deductions for expenses that are highly unusual in nature or represent capital expenditures rather than normal business operations.

## Question 3 (00:29:20 - 00:31:30)
What is the key issue when determining the deductibility of transactions between related parties?
A) The transaction must be reported on both parties' tax returns
B) One party may take the deduction while the other must report income
C) The transaction is usually not deductible by the paying party, but the recipient must report it as income
D) Related-party transactions are automatically disallowed as deductions

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** When transactions occur between related parties, the tax treatment often results in the paying party not being allowed to deduct the expense, while the receiving party must still include the amount as taxable income. This asymmetrical treatment is designed to prevent tax avoidance schemes between related entities. The IRS closely scrutinizes related-party transactions to ensure they're not being used to disguise non-deductible payments (like dividends) as deductible expenses (like compensation). This is a critical area where the IRS ensures it collects appropriate tax revenue.

## Question 4 (00:32:45 - 00:35:20)
What are the 2024 contribution limits for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for a family with both spouses over age 55?
A) $3,850 maximum
B) $4,850 maximum
C) $7,500 maximum
D) $9,500 maximum

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:** For 2024, the HSA contribution limits are set at $3,850 for self-only coverage, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowed for those age 55 and older (making it $4,850). For family coverage, the base contribution limit is $7,500. When both spouses are over age 55, they can each make the $1,000 catch-up contribution, bringing the total family contribution limit to $9,500. HSAs must be used in conjunction with a high-deductible health plan and can be established with a financial institution like a bank or mutual fund company.

## Question 5 (00:41:15 - 00:42:28)
How did the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act change the tax treatment of alimony payments?
A) It made alimony taxable to both the payer and recipient
B) It made alimony deductible to the recipient but not the payer
C) For divorces after 2018, alimony is neither deductible by the payer nor taxable to the recipient
D) It increased the tax rate on alimony payments

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly changed the tax treatment of alimony payments. For divorces executed or modified after 2018, alimony payments are no longer deductible for the payer, and the recipient no longer includes these payments in their gross income. This creates a clear distinction in tax treatment based on when the divorce was finalized. Divorces executed before 2019 were "grandfathered in" under the old rules, where alimony was deductible to the payer and taxable to the recipient. This change represents one of the significant modifications to personal taxation introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

## Key Concepts Summary

The federal income tax formula provides the framework for understanding how deductions reduce taxable income while credits directly reduce tax liability. Deductions come in two main forms: "for AGI" deductions (like retirement contributions) that benefit all taxpayers regardless of whether they itemize, and "from AGI" deductions (like charitable contributions) which must exceed the standard deduction to be beneficial. For a business expense to be deductible, it must be ordinary, necessary, and reasonable, with courts applying these standards to determine whether expenses have a legitimate business purpose rather than being personal in nature. Recent tax legislation, particularly the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, has significantly changed many deduction rules through 2025.
