# Quiz Questions on Income Tax Planning and Deductions

## Question 1 (00:42:28 - 00:46:58)
Which of the following statements is correct regarding alimony and divorce settlements executed before 2019?

A. Alimony payments are not taxable to the recipient
B. Alimony payments cannot be modified to change their tax treatment
C. Alimony payments are taxable income to the recipient and deductible by the payer
D. Alimony payments are considered earned income but not eligible for IRA contributions

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** For divorce agreements executed before 2019, alimony payments are treated as taxable income to the recipient and are tax-deductible by the payer. This tax treatment creates planning opportunities where both parties might benefit from modifying the payment amounts (receiving party accepting slightly less in exchange for maintaining the tax-advantaged status). However, any modification cannot change the fundamental tax treatment of these pre-2019 agreements. This differs significantly from post-2018 divorce agreements, where alimony is neither taxable to the recipient nor deductible by the payer.

## Question 2 (00:47:05 - 00:55:29)
For 2024, which statement is accurate regarding IRA contributions?

A. Contributions must be made by the extended due date of the tax return
B. Contributions are limited to $7,000 ($8,000 for those 50 and over) or 100% of includable compensation, whichever is less
C. Pension and annuity income can be used as qualifying compensation for IRA contributions
D. A non-working spouse cannot make IRA contributions even if filing jointly

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** For tax year 2024, IRA contributions are limited to the lesser of $7,000 ($8,000 for taxpayers age 50 and over) or 100% of includable compensation. Unlike qualified retirement plans, IRA contributions must be made by the due date of the return without regard to extensions (typically April 15th). Notably, compensation for IRA contribution purposes includes earned income and taxable alimony, but specifically excludes pensions, annuities, and other deferred compensation distributions. Additionally, a working spouse can contribute to an IRA for a non-working spouse if filing jointly, up to the same limits.

## Question 3 (00:56:44 - 01:05:35)
Which of the following charitable contribution scenarios is correct?

A. All charitable contributions have the same percentage limitation of 50% of AGI
B. Capital gain property donated to public charities is subject to a 30% of AGI limitation if the donor doesn't reduce the fair market value
C. Clothing donations in poor condition are deductible as long as they are valued under $500
D. Excess charitable contributions cannot be carried forward to future tax years

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** When a taxpayer donates capital gain property (property that would generate long-term capital gain if sold) to a public charity, a special 30% limitation applies if the donor elects not to reduce the fair market value by the amount that would have been long-term capital gain. This allows the donor to deduct the full fair market value but subjects them to a lower AGI limitation. If the donor elects to reduce the value, the 50% limitation would apply instead. Different limitations apply to different types of donations and charitable organizations, with excess contributions eligible for carryforward for five years. Clothing donations must be in good or better condition to be deductible.

## Question 4 (01:09:13 - 01:15:59)
What is the IRS's primary criterion for determining whether an activity is a hobby rather than a business?

A. Whether the activity generates personal pleasure
B. Whether the activity has produced a profit in any three of five consecutive tax years
C. Whether profit is a primary motive for the activity
D. The amount of time spent on the activity

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The Internal Revenue Code defines a hobby as an activity for which profit is not a primary motive. While there is a presumption that an activity is not a hobby if it produces profit in any three of five consecutive tax years (two of seven for horse-related activities), this is just one factor. The IRS examines multiple factors to determine whether an activity is carried on for profit, including how the taxpayer conducts the activity, expertise, time and effort expended, expectation of asset appreciation, success in similar activities, and elements of personal pleasure. If determined to be a hobby, losses from the activity cannot offset income from other sources.

## Question 5 (01:16:45 - 01:27:12)
Regarding the new clean vehicle (EV) credit available after 2022, which statement is accurate?

A. The maximum credit available is $3,750 for all qualifying electric vehicles
B. The credit has two components of $3,750 each, related to domestic content requirements
C. The credit is available regardless of the taxpayer's income level
D. The credit is only available for used electric vehicles

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** The new clean vehicle credit (EV credit) has two distinct components of $3,750 each. The first component applies if the vehicle satisfies a domestic test for critical minerals in the battery, and the second $3,750 applies if the vehicle satisfies domestic content requirements for battery components. This creates a potential maximum credit of $7,500. The credit is subject to income limitations and applies to qualified new clean vehicles placed in service after 2022. It represents part of the broader policy initiatives to encourage domestic manufacturing and adoption of cleaner energy technologies.
